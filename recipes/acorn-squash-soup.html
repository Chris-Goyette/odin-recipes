    <p>Sweet, nutty acorn squash and fresh, creamy Shamrock Farms Heavy Whipping Cream come together to create this warm and inviting soup, perfect for a crisp fall evening. For some crunchy contrast, we added some homemade sourdough croutons as garnish.</p>

                    <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>

                    <li>1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves, plus more for serving</li>
                    <li>4 c. low-sodium chicken stock</li>
                    <li>1/2 c. Shamrock Farms Heavy Whipping Cream, divided</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>Large pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                    <li>1/3 c. grated Parmesan</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the croutons: Preheat oven to 325˚F. In a large bowl, combine butter, paprika, and a large pinch of salt. Add bread cubes and toss to coat. Sprinkle with cheese and toss again. Spread in an even layer on a baking tray. Bake, tossing a few times, until golden and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Make the soup: Increase oven temperature to 425˚F. Drizzle cut sides of squash with 2 tablespoons oil, season with salt and pepper, and arrange cut-side down on a baking sheet. Bake until fork-tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Flip cut-side up and let cool slightly. Scoop roasted squash out of skins, discarding outer skin. Reduce oven temperature to 325˚F. </li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in the broth and add the scooped squash, Worcestershire, nutmeg, and cayenne. Increase heat to high and simmer for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Using an immersion blender, blend soup until creamy. Return heat to medium-high and add the Parmesan and ¼ cup Shamrock Farms Heavy Whipping Cream. Cook, stirring, until soup is smooth and hot, about 2 minutes more. </li>
            <li>Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle with remaining heavy cream, and top with croutons and more thyme leaves.</li>
        </ol>
